Jupiter: Postman’s Looker Dashboard Review Tool is poised to become an essential asset for the Looker community by automating and streamlining the dashboard review process. Using a simple interface, the tool provides instant feedback on improvements to metrics, as well as visual and text storytelling. Therefore, Jupiter eliminates the tedious and error-prone task of manual checks. This idea came from our own experiences discovering errors in crucial dashboards months after a small change to a tile or missing out on checks due to multiple dashboard review cycles. In its future scope, Jupiter aims to become a combination of AI-driven suggestions and rule-based validations. Admins will be able to provide runtime data, trust metrics, dashboard LookML etc. and add custom guidelines in an easy-to-use interface for guideline management. In this way, “best practices” do not live in a maze of documents, but are used to guide LookML developers realtime. Future versions will also allow users to approve actions once the suggestions are reviewed to further reduce manual effort or schedule periodic checks on important dashboards. Thus, Jupiter not only boosts productivity but also elevates the overall quality and consistency of dashboards, making it an indispensable tool for Looker users.
